# IAC
Infrastructure as Code (IAC) Repository

This is a repository for managing our infrastructure as code (IAC). We use IAC to automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of our infrastructure resources, such as servers, databases, and networking components, in a repeatable and scalable way.

In this repository, you will find the following folders:

environments: This folder contains the configuration files for our different environments, such as development, staging, and production. Each environment has its own set of variables and settings that define its infrastructure resources.

modules: This folder contains the reusable building blocks of our infrastructure, such as network subnets, security groups, and server configurations. Each module is designed to be modular, composable, and reusable across different environments and projects.

scripts: This folder contains the automation scripts that we use to deploy, configure, and manage our infrastructure resources. These scripts are written in Python and use popular infrastructure tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation.

templates: This folder contains the templates for our infrastructure resources, such as server images, database schemas, and network topologies. These templates are designed to be versioned, tested, and deployed as part of our continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

Our IAC repository follows the GitOps principles, which means that all changes to our infrastructure resources are made through Git pull requests and are automatically deployed to our environments using a CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that our infrastructure is versioned, auditable, and reproducible across different environments and team members.

Feel free to contribute to this repository by submitting pull requests, reporting issues, or suggesting improvements to our infrastructure codebase. Together, we can build a scalable, resilient, and secure infrastructure that meets our organization's needs.
